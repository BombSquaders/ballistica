class Session:
    """Defines a high level series of activities with a common purpose.

    category: Gameplay Classes

    Examples of sessions are ba.FreeForAllSession, ba.DualTeamSession, and
    ba.CoopSession.

    A Session is responsible for wrangling and transitioning between various
    ba.Activity instances such as mini-games and score-screens, and for
    maintaining state between them (players, teams, score tallies, etc).

    Attributes:

        teams
            All the ba.Teams in the Session. Most things should use the team
            list in ba.Activity; not this.

        players
            All ba.Players in the Session. Most things should use the player
            list in ba.Activity; not this. Some players, such as those who have
            not yet selected a character, will only appear on this list.

        min_players
            The minimum number of Players who must be present for the Session
            to proceed past the initial joining screen.

        max_players
            The maximum number of Players allowed in the Session.

        lobby
            The ba.Lobby instance where new ba.Players go to select a
            Profile/Team/etc. before being added to games.
            Be aware this value may be None if a Session does not allow
            any such selection.

        campaign
            The ba.Campaign instance this Session represents, or None if
            there is no associated Campaign.
